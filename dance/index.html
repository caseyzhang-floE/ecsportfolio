	  <h3> The History of Hip Hop Dance </h3>
	  <p> Hip-hop dance began during the late 1960's and early 1970's, originally inspired by the movements of African dancing, and flourished as a new style of dance performed on the street for the people. Hip-hop incorporates aspects of modern dance, tap, and swing, integrating music and complex movements to form artistry. So far, thanks to its huge popularization--it's one of the most popular forms of dance in modern times!</p>
	  <h3> How I Started </h3>	  
	  <p> I first began dancing when I was around 10, inspired by big dance groups such as Jam Republic. I've always been self-taught, as my family couldn't afford actual, professional training. Although I have been dancing for around 3 years, I still believe I'm a beginner---which only motivates me to try harder! </p>
	  <h3> My Idols </h3>
	  <ol> 
		  <li>A huge person I admire when it comes to dance is Kirsten from Jam Republic, a Korean dance crew. Personally, she was what inspired me to actually take the hobby a bit more seriously, and her powerful moves constantly amaze me.</li>
		  <li>Probably one of the hugest contributors to my passion for dane, is Nishimura Riki--a popular K-POP idol, who I believe really focuses mainly on hip hop. Not only has he done various forms of dance including ballet, his talent constantly suprises and inspires me!
		  <li>A dance crew I think is one of the best, is the Philippine All Stars, I hope one day I can become part of a group that is as synced as them.</li>
		  <li>1MILLION has probably some of the best dancers I've seen in modern times, and I mostly find myself admiring those specializing in tutting, and footwork choreos.</li>

	  <h3> What I Hope to Acheive in the Future With My Interest </h3>
	  <p>Although I'm planning on prioritizing making sure I get into a good college, dance will always be a big part of my life no matter what! I hope that when I'm older, or have the ability to afford lessons--I'll be able to regularly participate in dance workshops that keep my body moving.</p>
