	  <h3> How I Started </h3>	  
	  <p> I first began dancing when I was around 10, inspired by big dance groups such as Jam Republic. I've always been self-taught, as my family couldn't afford actual, professional training. Although I have been dancing for around 3 years, I still believe I'm a beginner---which only motivates me to try harder! </p>
	  <h3> My Idols </h3>
	  <ol> 
		  <li>A huge person I admire when it comes to dance is Kirsten from Jam Republic, a Korean dance crew. Personally, she was what inspired me to actually take the hobby a bit more seriously, and her powerful moves constantly amaze me.</li>
		  <li>A dance crew I think is one of the best, is the Philippine All Stars, I hope one day I can become part of a group that is as synced as them.</li>
		  <li>1MILLION has probably some of the best dancers I've seen in modern times, and I mostly find myself admiring those specializing in tutting, and footwork choreos.</li>
